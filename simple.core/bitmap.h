		Bitmap Pixel Formats:  bV5BitCount

		Value 	Meaning
		0 	The number of bits per pixel is specified or is implied by the JPEG or PNG file format.

		1 	The bitmap is monochrome, and the bmiColors member of BITMAPINFO contains two entries.
			Each bit in the bitmap array represents a pixel. If the bit is clear, the pixel is displayed
			with the color of the first entry in the bmiColors color table. If the bit is set, the pixel
			has the color of the second entry in the table.

		4 	The bitmap has a maximum of 16 colors, and the bmiColors member of BITMAPINFO contains up to
			16 entries. Each pixel in the bitmap is represented by a 4-bit index into the color table.
			For example, if the first byte in the bitmap is 0x1F, the byte represents two pixels. The first
			pixel contains the color in the second table entry, and the second pixel contains the color in
			the sixteenth table entry.

		8 	The bitmap has a maximum of 256 colors, and the bmiColors member of BITMAPINFO contains up to
			256 entries. In this case, each byte in the array represents a single pixel.

		16 	The bitmap has a maximum of 2^16 colors. If the bV5Compression member of the BITMAPV5HEADER structure
			is BI_RGB, the bmiColors member of BITMAPINFO is NULL. Each WORD in the bitmap array represents a
			single pixel. The relative intensities of red, green, and blue are represented with five bits for
			each color component. The value for blue is in the least significant five bits, followed by five
			bits each for green and red. The most significant bit is not used. The bmiColors color table is
			used for optimizing colors used on palette-based devices, and must contain the number of entries specified
			by the bV5ClrUsed member of the BITMAPV5HEADER.If the bV5Compression member of the BITMAPV5HEADER
			is BI_BITFIELDS, the bmiColors member contains three DWORD color masks that specify the red, green,
			and blue components, respectively, of each pixel. Each WORD in the bitmap array represents a single pixel.

		When the bV5Compression member is BI_BITFIELDS, bits set in each DWORD mask must be contiguous and should not
		overlap the bits of another mask. All the bits in the pixel do not need to be used.

		24 	The bitmap has a maximum of 2^24 colors, and the bmiColors member of BITMAPINFO is NULL. Each 3-byte triplet
			in the bitmap array represents the relative intensities of blue, green, and red, respectively, for a pixel.
			The bmiColors color table is used for optimizing colors used on palette-based devices, and must contain the
			number of entries specified by the bV5ClrUsed member of the BITMAPV5HEADER structure.

		32 	The bitmap has a maximum of 2^32 colors. If the bV5Compression member of the BITMAPV5HEADER is BI_RGB, the
			bmiColors member of BITMAPINFO is NULL. Each DWORD in the bitmap array represents the relative intensities
			of blue, green, and red for a pixel. The value for blue is in the least significant 8 bits, followed by 8
			bits each for green and red. The high byte in each DWORD is not used. The bmiColors color table is used for
			optimizing colors used on palette-based devices, and must contain the number of entries specified by the
			bV5ClrUsed member of the BITMAPV5HEADER.If the bV5Compression member of the BITMAPV5HEADER is BI_BITFIELDS,
			the bmiColors member contains three DWORD color masks that specify the red, green, and blue components of each
			pixel. Each DWORD in the bitmap array represents a single pixel.

	/*

		Compression:  bV5Compression

		Value 			Meaning

		BI_RGB 			An uncompressed format.

		BI_RLE8 		A run-length encoded (RLE) format for bitmaps with 8 bpp. The compression format is a two-byte
						format consisting of a count byte followed by a byte containing a color index. If bV5Compression
						is BI_RGB and the bV5BitCount member is 16, 24, or 32, the bitmap array specifies the actual
						intensities of blue, green, and red rather than using color table indexes. For more information,
						see Bitmap Compression.

		BI_RLE4 		An RLE format for bitmaps with 4 bpp. The compression format is a two-byte format consisting of
						a count byte followed by two word-length color indexes. For more information, see Bitmap Compression.

		BI_BITFIELDS 	Specifies that the bitmap is not compressed and that the color masks for the red, green, and blue
						components of each pixel are specified in the bV5RedMask, bV5GreenMask, and bV5BlueMask members.
						This is valid when used with 16- and 32-bpp bitmaps.

		BI_ALPHABITFIELDS (ALSO!!) (PLEASE CHECK MSFT HEADER)

		BI_JPEG 		Specifies that the image is compressed using the JPEG file Interchange Format. JPEG compression
						trades off compression against loss; it can achieve a compression ratio of 20:1 with little noticeable loss.

		BI_PNG 			Specifies that the image is compressed using the PNG file Interchange Format.
